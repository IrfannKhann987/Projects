# ðŸ“§ Spam Classifier using NLP and Machine Learning

A machine learning project to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project takes a dataset of SMS messages and builds a spam detection model using text preprocessing and classification algorithms. It includes steps from data cleaning to model evaluation.

---

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- Dataset used: [Your Dataset Name or Source]
- Contains labeled messages (`spam` or `ham`)
- Features: `transformed_text`, `target`

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- WordCloud
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Google Colab

---

## ðŸ“Š EDA & Preprocessing

- Checked for null values
- Cleaned and tokenized the text
- Removed stopwords and punctuation
- Performed vectorization (e.g. TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
- Created WordClouds for spam vs. ham
- you will get all the graphs necessary

---

## ðŸ¤– Models Used

- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (optional)
- Logistic Regression (optional)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- NLP techniques like stemming and tokenization
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF/CountVectorizer
- Model comparison and metric analysis
- Importance of preprocessing in text classification
